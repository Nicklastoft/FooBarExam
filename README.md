# Nicklas T. Povlsen - MMD Frontend18 - Exam

This is made entirely as a school project for my 3rd semester exam.

## About the project

This project is all about a dashboard for a beer-slinging bar to use. Technically the ideas and methods can be reused for similar projects, but alas this is merely intended to provide solid info for a owner or off-duty bartender to be well informed and have an easier time helping out.

## Usage & screen sizes

* This dashboard project was only ever intended to be used in conjunction with a 16:9 format screen in atleast a HD-ready size (1280x720) - anything below will not yield the result you are hoping for.

## Deployment

* To deploy the site, only use the "build" folder, source is purely there for redundancy - It is however in "source" that you will find a .css and .js file which has not yet been compiled / transpiled and therefore is more readable.

## Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The editor used
* [Node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) - This might be why you find my CSS so neat and tidy :)

## Authors

* **Nicklas Toft Povlsen** - [ntp-design](http://ntp-design.com/)

## Acknowledgments

* Stine Andersson for technical advisement
* Chartjs for beautiful graphs and inspiration
* All of the excellent lectures in class at KEA!
